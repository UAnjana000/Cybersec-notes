    "### üõ°Ô∏è What is **Defensive Security**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defensive Security** is all about protecting systems, networks, and data from cyberattacks. It focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prevention:** Firewalls, antivirus, access controls\n",
    "* **Detection:** Intrusion detection systems (IDS), monitoring logs\n",
    "* **Response:** Incident response plans, threat mitigation\n",
    "* **Recovery:** Backups, system restoration\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the shield to offensive security‚Äôs sword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of roles:\n",
    "üîπ SOC Analyst\n",
    "üîπ Blue Team Operator\n",

    "\n",
    "**Gobuster is an *offensive* tool**, primarily used by penetration testers and red teamers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **defensive teams** use Gobuster in a different context:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To simulate attacks internally and **harden defenses** (e.g., check what a malicious actor might discover).\n",
    "* To test **web server exposure** and **enumerate assets** to ensure there are no misconfigurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Gobuster itself isn‚Äôt a defensive tool‚Äîbut can be used **defensively** in proactive security assessments.\n",

    "### üîß Bash Commands for Gobuster (Used Defensively to Discover Weak Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîπ Check for exposed directories:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "gobuster dir -u http://your-organization.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "gobuster vhost -u http://your-organization.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/vhosts.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîπ Check for forgotten or insecure subdomains:\n",

    "gobuster dir -u http://your-organization.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/common.txt -x php,html,txt,bak\n",

    "These scans help **defensive teams**:\n",

    "* Reduce attack surface\n",

    "Introduction to Defensive Security\n",
    "In the previous room, we learned about offensive security, which aims to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities to enhance security measures. This includes exploiting software bugs, leveraging insecure setups, and taking advantage of unenforced access control policies, among other strategies. Red teams and penetration testers specialize in these offensive techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this room, we will examine its counterpart, defensive security. It is concerned with two main tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing intrusions from occurring\n",
    "Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly\n",
    "Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:\n",
    "\n",
    "User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems.\n",
    "Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately.\n",
    "Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).\n",
    "Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.\n",
    "Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.\n",
    "There is much more to defensive security. Aside from the above, we will also cover the following related topics:\n",
