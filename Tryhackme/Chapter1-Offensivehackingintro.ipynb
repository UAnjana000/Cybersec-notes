    "\n",
    "* **Reconnaissance** (finding information about a target)\n",
    "* **Vulnerability scanning**\n",
    "* **Exploitation** (testing weak points)\n",
    "* **Post-exploitation** (what an attacker could do after gaining access)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal? **Strengthen security through simulated attacks**.\n",
